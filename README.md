- I'm interest in lerning everything that's to learnig, but we all know that's not possible. 
- I decided to start learning python, focusing in text based games and incremental games.
- My focus is what it is because my own interest in playing this kind of game, so I realized "Why not doing my own game in my favorite gender?"
- I really know pratically nothing, with some experience in HTML (java, css, etc.), but I realized that I was studing some that I dind't love.
- That's why I'm here, to learn and create things that really make me stay up all night in a good way.
- I'm looking to collaborate with game makers, pacient people and people that are willing to invest in my ideas (knowledge invest, time invest, friendship invest)
- Reach me on my intagram @silmsm, or my email juniorsilmar@outlook.com. DM me anywhere you find me and let's have a chat
